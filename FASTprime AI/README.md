# OS Assignment 1 - AI Solution
    
This is the AI generated code for the assignment.

## Code
The file `primeAI.c` was generated using an AI model.
I had to make small changes to make it work on Mac (specifically the lscpu part), but the rest is what the AI gave.

## How to Run

1. Compile:
   ```bash
   gcc primeAI.c -lm
   ```

2. Run:
   ```bash
   ./a.out
   ```
   
   Enter the range and processes when it asks.

## Results
The `results/` folder has the plots I generated.
I used the same python script from my manual solution to make these plots.

## Meta
See `ai_meta.txt` for the prompt I used.
